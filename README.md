# .GitIgnore
A .gitignore file for general use. PHP, Node.js, Vim, Eclipse, osX and Windows, etc
Here is the .gitignore that I add to most projects. The ultimate ignore file for any git code base.

include ignore files/folders under any sub folder for projects flutter, node, angular, react, next.js, vercel, netlify, aws, azure, php, wordpress, codeignitor, python, c, c++, ai, localhost, java, c#, asp.net, .net, flex, action script, flash, animation, asm programming, hybrid app, react native, ios, xcode, mac os, windows, linux, android, android studio, vscode, eclipse, netbeans, atom, IDLE, spyder, Arduino IDE, visual studio, intelij, dreamwever, photoshop, browser, testing tools, runtime and logging, temp files

You can create a pull request or comment to add any additional project or file/folder to ignore.
